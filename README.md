# Diivavälitys website, a client project
This is a static website I built for a client, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The project was intentionally built without frameworks to truly get to the core of web technologies.
Through this project, I strengthened my skills on HTML and CSS, and gained experience on JavaScript in a real-world project.

The project was done in close collaboration with the client, and the structure evolved based on their needs.
After delivery, maintenance was handed over to the client.

If I were to redo this project now, I would likely
- look into using templates for artist pages to reduce repetition
- normalize the naming of assets for better readability and maintainability
- consider using modern tools and frameworks for smoother workflows
